# MVC - All Things MVC

One of the more popular and powerful features of Dotnet Core is Microsoft's MVC Capabilities. This section is to show case some of the useful things Ive learnt and thought it useful to share. Note this is not a full guide to what MVC is and how it works but rather, common things that took me quite a while to figure out. A collection of tricks and learnings.
