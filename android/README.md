# Android 

This is the opening section to the documentation of Android. Due to the large amount of information with regards to Android development in particular. This Section has been broken down into modules namely Android - Java and Android - Kotlin. Links are in the table below:

| Android - Kotlin | [Find Here](./sub-sections/kotlin/README.md) |
